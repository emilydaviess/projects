#Goals of the analysis
######################

#We want to answer questions like:

#1.Over what period do we have data for trending videos for GB?  
#2.Which five videos appeared the most on the trending-videos list?
#3.Which category of video appears the most on the trending-videos list?
#4.What proportion of videos on the trending list are Music (category 10)?
#5.Which YouTube channel overall has had the most views in the trending-videos?
#6.What are the top five videos that overall had the..
  #a.Most views in the trending-videos list?
  #b.Most likes in the trending-videos list?
  #c.Most dislikes  in the trending-videos list?
  #d.Most comments  in the trending-videos list?
#7.Which three Music videos (category 10) have had the most likes in the trending-videos list?
#8.How many trending videos contain a fully capitalized word in their titles?
  #a.Is there any correlation between a video having a capitalised word and number of views?
#9.What are the lengths of trending video titles? Does the length of video title correlate with the number of views a video gets?
  #a.Are there any categories which have a high correlation between title length and the number of views a video gets? If so, which, and with a positive/negative correlation?
#10.How are views, likes, dislikes, comment count, title length, and other attributes correlate with (relate to) each other? 
  #a.What is the correlation between views and comment count, is it positively or negatively correlated?
#11.What are the most common words in trending video titles?
#12.When weâ€™re trending videos published? On which days of the week? at which times of the day?
  
#Getting a feel of the dataset.

#Now, let's see some information about our dataset

#We can see that there are 38,916 entries in the dataset.

#8a. How many trending videos contain a fully-capitalized word in their titles?
#8a. Is there any correlation between a video having a capitalised word and number of views?

#Now we want to see how many trending video titles contain at least a capitalized word (e.g. HOW). 
#To do that, we will add a new variable (column) to the dataset whose value is True if the video title has at least a capitalized word in it, and False otherwise

#10. How are views, likes, dislikes, comment count, title length, and other attributes correlate with (relate to) each other? How are they connected?
#10a. What is the correlation between views and comment count, is it positively or negativley correlated?

#Now let's see how the dataset variables are correlated with each other: 
#for example, we would like to see how views and likes are correlated, 
#meaning do views and likes increase and decrease together (positive correlation)? 
#Does one of them increase when the other decrease and vice versa (negative correlation)? 
#Or are they not correlated?

#Correlation is represented as a value between -1 and +1 where +1 denotes the highest positive correlation, 
#-1 denotes the highest negative correlation, 
#and 0 denotes that there is no correlation.

#11. What are the most common words in trending music video titles (cat 10)?

#Let's see if there are some words that are used significantly in trending video titles.
#We will display the 25 most common words in all trending video titles.

#Create a vector containing only the text
